First Submission Document Feedback:
  1. Use Cases:
      - format is right
      - The Use cases are given in the lecture? Do we need to follow them directly; can we split?
      - Split into turn phase, troop distribution -> Why did we split? explain that we understood
      what use cases are for and why we splitted it

  2. Domain Model:
      - Network does not exist in the real world;
      - Domain Model is what "exists in the real world";
      - Domain Model should explain what playing Risiko on an actual board looks like
      - not explaining the technical implementation
      - we don't need to follow the classes
