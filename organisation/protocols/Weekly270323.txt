Janadler recommends to use Maven
Leo has issues including Maven into the project, Janadler will help us if remains not working
Tip from Janadler: empty Maven project and copy code or copy Maven files

Presentation for First Submission:
- @lkuech @lgreiner
- Deadline for first draft: 28.03.2023, send it to Janadler e.o.d.

Not everybody has to present, but everyone should be able to answer questions
Better to let everybody present, so no one will be picked specifically to answer questions
Focus of the presentation should be: Project Management and approach, include buzzwords like Scrum and Agile, Daily/Weekly sprints
Atkinson is fan of Modelling -> use non-trivial diagrams, operation contracts, domain model, ...

Leo has a question regarding how to include database into our projects
We can simply add a SQLite file to our project, locally for every "server"
No need to use MySQL

Leo doesn't have to pay for his delay because our meeting on Friday wasn't specified clearly enough
Coming meetings on Fridays have to be announced more clearly (at latest the day before e.o.d.)
